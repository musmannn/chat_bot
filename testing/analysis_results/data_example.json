Tolkien. \"The Hobbit\" is a prequel to \"The Lord of the Rings\" and is also a popular and beloved work by the same author. It follows the journey of Bilbo Baggins as he is recruited by Gandalf to help the Dwarves reclaim their lost kingdom from the dragon Smaug. It's a great read if you're looking for more of the rich world-building and adventure that you enjoyed in \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
